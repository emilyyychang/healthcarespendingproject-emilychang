This project explores whether increased healthcare expenditure per capita is positively correlated with lower preventable deaths, shorter hospital stays, greater access to medical technology, and higher life expectancies at birth across OECD countries from 2000 to 2019. Our hypothesis was that greater healthcare spending would be positively correlated with our chosen categories across countries.
